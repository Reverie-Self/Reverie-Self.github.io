    <p>
        I used to explode—ignite on command<br>
        A flash, a roar, just smoke in their hands<br>
        Thought I was the bomb, thought I made them shake<br>
        But all I left were echoes, just another mistake<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Stopped and stared—what did I find?<br>
        A wasteland carved from the wreckage inside<br>
        Take care, take care—your actions remain<br>
        Every ember still whispers my name<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        So I turned inward, nowhere to go<br>
        Detonation—imploding slow<br>
        Scars uncoiled like venom in veins<br>
        Burning through me, but no one remains<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Weak, I sit—hollowed and torn<br>
        Strength, I seek—but I'm weathered, worn<br>
        Pain’s the only ghost that stays<br>
        Ripping through me in endless waves<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        The fire is fed, the wound is wide<br>
        Flesh from soul, no place to hide<br>
        Memory slips like smoke in rain<br>
        Will I ever feel again?<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Detonate, detonate—fire in my bones!<br>
        Let it burn or turn to stone!<br>
        Ashes settle, but I still breathe<br>
        Am I lost, or am I free?<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        I used to explode… now I just fade…<br>
    </p>
